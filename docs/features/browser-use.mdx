## Overview

Browser Use transforms Roo Code into a powerful web automation assistant. Whether you're testing your web application, gathering information from websites, or automating repetitive browser tasks, Roo can handle it all through an integrated browser that runs seamlessly within your development environment.

### Key Capabilities

- **Automated Web Testing**: Test your web applications by having Roo interact with forms, buttons, and navigation
- **Information Gathering**: Extract data from websites, check page layouts, and verify content
- **Screenshot Capture**: Automatically capture and analyze web page screenshots
- **Form Interaction**: Fill out forms, submit data, and interact with complex web interfaces
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Verify your site works correctly across different viewport sizes
- **Session Persistence**: Maintain authenticated sessions when using remote browser connections

---

## How Browser Use Works

By default, Roo Code uses a built-in Puppeteer-controlled browser that:

- Launches automatically when you ask Roo to visit a website
- Captures screenshots of web pages for visual analysis
- Allows Roo to interact with web elements through clicks, typing, and scrolling
- Runs invisibly in the background (headless mode)
- Closes automatically when the task is complete

All of this happens directly within VS Code, with no additional setup required.

### Browser Session Lifecycle

1. **Launch**: Browser starts when you request web interaction
2. **Navigate**: Roo opens the specified URL
3. **Interact**: Performs requested actions (click, type, scroll)
4. **Capture**: Takes screenshots after each action
5. **Analyze**: Roo examines the page state and console output
6. **Close**: Browser terminates when task completes

---

## Using Browser Use

### Basic Usage

A typical browser interaction follows this pattern:

**Important:** Browser Use requires Claude Sonnet 3.5 or 3.7 model.

1. Ask Roo to visit a website
2. Roo launches the browser and shows you a screenshot
3. Request additional actions (clicking, typing, scrolling)
4. Roo closes the browser when finished

### Example Requests

**Simple Website Check:**

```
Open the browser and view our site at https://example.com
```

**Testing Local Development:**

```
Can you check if my website at http://localhost:3000 is displaying correctly?
```

**Complex Interaction:**

```
Browse http://localhost:3000, scroll down to the bottom of the page and check if the footer information is displaying correctly. Then click the "Contact" link and verify the contact form is working.
```

**Form Testing:**

```
Go to our contact form at https://example.com/contact, fill in the form with test data, and verify the validation messages appear correctly.
```

## How Browser Actions Work

The browser_action tool controls a browser instance that returns screenshots and console logs after each action, allowing you to see the results of interactions.

### Key Characteristics

- **Sequential Operations**: Each browser session must start with `launch` and end with `close`
- **Single Action Per Message**: Only one browser action can be used per message
- **Exclusive Tool Use**: While the browser is active, no other tools can be used
- **Response Feedback**: You must wait for the response (screenshot and logs) before performing the next action
- **State Persistence**: The browser maintains state between actions within a session

### Available Browser Actions

| Action        | Description                    | When to Use                           | Example                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `launch`      | Opens a browser at a URL       | Starting a new browser session        | Testing homepage load     |
| `click`       | Clicks at specific coordinates | Interacting with buttons, links, etc. | Submitting forms          |
| `type`        | Types text into active element | Filling forms, search boxes           | Entering user credentials |
| `scroll_down` | Scrolls down by one page       | Viewing content below the fold        | Checking footer content   |
| `scroll_up`   | Scrolls up by one page         | Returning to previous content         | Navigating back to header |
| `close`       | Closes the browser             | Ending a browser session              | Cleanup after testing     |

### Action Sequencing

Browser actions must follow a logical sequence:

```
launch → navigate → interact (click/type/scroll) → capture → close
```

Each action builds on the previous state, allowing complex multi-step interactions.

   <img
     src="/img/browser-use/browser-use-2.png"
     alt="Enable browser tool setting"
     width="300"
   />

### Viewport Size

**Purpose**: Determines the resolution of the browser session Roo Code uses. This affects how websites render and what content is visible.

**Tradeoff**: Higher resolutions provide a larger viewport but increase token usage due to larger screenshots.

**Available Options:**

| Resolution    | Dimensions | Best For                    | Token Impact |
| ------------- | ---------- | --------------------------- | ------------ |
| Large Desktop | 1280x800   | Full desktop layouts        | Highest      |
| Small Desktop | 900x600    | Standard web apps (Default) | Medium       |
| Tablet        | 768x1024   | Responsive testing          | Medium       |
| Mobile        | 360x640    | Mobile-first testing        | Lowest       |

To change this setting:

1. Click the dropdown menu under "Viewport size" within your Browser / Computer Use settings
2. Select your desired resolution

   <img
     src="/img/browser-use/browser-use-3.png"
     alt="Viewport size setting dropdown"
     width="600"
   />

**Choosing the Right Viewport:**

- **Large Desktop**: Use when testing complex layouts or applications that require more screen real estate
- **Small Desktop**: Ideal for most web applications and general testing
- **Tablet**: Perfect for testing responsive designs and touch interfaces
- **Mobile**: Essential for mobile-first development and testing mobile user experiences

### Screenshot Quality

**Purpose**: Controls the WebP compression quality of browser screenshots. This directly impacts both visual clarity and token consumption.

**Tradeoff**: Higher quality provides clearer screenshots but increases token usage.

**Quality Guidelines:**

| Quality Range | Use Case                    | Visual Impact        | Token Usage |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------- |
| 1-40%         | Text-only pages             | Basic readability    | Minimal     |
| 40-60%        | Simple layouts              | Good for most text   | Low         |
| 60-75%        | Standard web apps (Default) | Clear UI elements    | Medium      |
| 75-85%        | Design review               | High visual fidelity | High        |
| 85-100%       | Pixel-perfect testing       | Maximum clarity      | Very High   |

To change this setting:

1. Adjust the slider under "Screenshot quality" within your Browser / Computer Use settings
2. Set a value between 1-100% (default is 75%)

   <img
     src="/img/browser-use/browser-use-4.png"
     alt="Screenshot quality slider"
     width="600"
   />

**Optimization Tips:**

- Start with lower quality (40-50%) for text-heavy sites
- Increase to 80%+ only when visual details are critical
- Consider token costs when working with limited API budgets
- Use higher quality for debugging visual issues

### Remote Browser Connection

**Purpose**: Connect Roo to an existing Chrome browser instead of using the built-in headless browser. This enables advanced workflows and persistent sessions.

**Benefits:**

- **Persistent Sessions**: Maintain logged-in states between Roo sessions
- **Visual Monitoring**: Watch Roo interact with websites in real-time
- **Custom Profiles**: Use browser profiles with specific extensions or settings
- **Container Support**: Works in DevContainers and remote development environments
- **Debugging**: See exactly what Roo sees during interactions

**Requirements**: Chrome must be running with remote debugging enabled on port 9222.

To enable this feature:

1. Check the "Use remote browser connection" box in Browser / Computer Use settings
2. Click "Test Connection" to verify

   <img
